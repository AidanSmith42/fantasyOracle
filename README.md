Fantasy Football Forecasts, DFS Optimizer, Visualizations

All in one Fantasy Football resource with weekly ranks and forecasts, visualizations, and optimal dfs lineups.

Uses many data science techniques such as web scraping, random forests, linear programming, kmeans clustering, visualization, unstructured data manipulation & managing data from multiple sources.

Fun project that I've used with good results in my Fantasy league and in Daily Fantasy.
